<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a seasoned healthcare professional and occupational therapist with over two decades of clinical experience, I bring a unique perspective to the intersection of healthcare and technology. My career has evolved from direct patient care to leveraging health informatics to drive practice transformation and improve patient outcomes. This journey has instilled in me a deep passion for developing and implementing technology solutions that enhance operational efficiency within primary care settings, particularly intuitive documentation systems designed for seamless point-of-service use."</p>

<p>Beyond my clinical and technical expertise, I possess strong interpersonal skills honed through years of occupational therapy. This includes exceptional salesmanship, coaching, and a commitment to providing excellent customer service. I believe that effective change management and technology adoption rely not only on technical prowess but also on the ability to communicate effectively, build rapport, and foster a collaborative environment. I am adept at navigating complex situations, influencing stakeholders, and inspiring confidence in new technologies.</p>

<p>Driven by a commitment to empowering clinicians and improving patient care, I am currently expanding my technical skills through Udemy courses with the ultimate goal of creating an innovative documentation system tailored for Early Intervention (EI) services. I envision a system that is not only technologically advanced but also user-friendly, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated into the daily workflow of EI practitioners. This system will streamline documentation, reduce administrative burden, and ultimately allow clinicians to focus on what matters most: providing high-quality care to children and families.</p>
