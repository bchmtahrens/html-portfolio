<h1>The Best Movies According to Christy</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>This classic film has fantastic songs, exemplary acting and a marvelous story. I could watch it again and again.</p>

<h3>Pollyanna</h3>
<p>This movie shows how kindness can be contagious, however it is not as easily caught as complaining. This is another feel-good classis.</p>

<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p> I think it is the stellar acting in this movie that keeps me coming back and the beautiful Alaskan scenary. Plu the love story is timeless.</p>
